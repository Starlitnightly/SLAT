# Tutorials

``SLAT`` alignment can finish in GPU server in less than 100 seconds, and also can run on laptop with 16GB memory without GPU in less than 10min!
We provide following tutorials for you to get started quickly.

## Basic Usage
We will show you how to use ``SLAT`` to align single cell spatial data. You can find core functions of ``SLAT`` in this tutorial.

## Multi-data alignment
``SLAT`` can also align multiple datasets once, which is important for 3D structure reconstruction.

## Time-series alignment
In this tutorial, we focus on find dynamic regions in embryo development by ``SLAT``.
